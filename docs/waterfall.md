## During the MSIS program

Before the conclusion of the <abbr title = "Agile, Processes, and Automation"> APA </abbr> module, you will be required to learn both Agile and Waterfall, two methodologies that are used across development lifecycles. These two methodologies will serve you well across the various assignments and projects you work on throughout the program. However, you must understand the advantages and disadvantages of using each one. You will work through a handful of assignments, including a simulation by the end of the module to ensure you can effectively identify and use the two methodologies. For now, we will focus primarily on Waterfall, its concepts and main uses. If you are interested in learning more about Agile, please refer to the appropriate module.

## During the MSIS program

Before the conclusion of the <abbr title = "Agile, Processes, and Automation"> APA </abbr> module, you will be required to learn both Agile and Waterfall, two methodologies that are used across development lifecycles. These two methodologies will serve you well across the various assignments and projects you work on throughout the program. However, you must understand the advantages and disadvantages of using each one. You will work through a handful of assignments, including a simulation by the end of the module to ensure you can effectively identify and use the two methodologies. For now, we will focus primarily on Waterfall, its concepts and main uses. If you are interested in learning more about Agile, please refer to the appropriate module.

## Major concepts

1. Phases of _**Waterfall**_
    1. _**Planning/Analysis:**_ Primarily focuses on gathering project requirements by conducting primary research and interviews with key project stakeholders. This phase will conclude once requirements have been clearly identified and agreed upon between the development team and stakeholders.
    2. _**Design:**_ Builds directly off of the first phase and requires no coding to occur. This phase is primarily focused on establishing the technical needs of the project.
    3. _**Construction/Build:**_ Involves the main build-out of the desired solution, this phase tends to be code heavy and aims to meet the requirements set fourth throughout the previous two phases.  
    4. _**Testing:**_ Occurs once  main software development has concluded; issues may arise causing you to revert to the previous phase.
    5. _**Implementation/Deployment:**_ Product development has concluded and the final deliverable will now be put into use throughout an organization. This signals the move to post-development support.
    6. _**Maintenance/Support:**_ Occurs once the final product has been delivered and is actively being used within an organization. _When_, not if, issues arise, your team must be ready to respond and update the software to address those issues. On occasion issues may require you to roll back the product version to a previously stable version.
2. Primary _**Advantages**_ of Waterfall
    1. Simple, easy to utilize on small projects
    2. Centralized, great for Communication throughout the <abbr title = "Software Development Lifecycle"> SDLC </abbr>
    3. Easily managed
    4. Defined end goal throughout project duration
3. Primary _**Disadvantages**_ of Waterfall
    1. Working software is not produced until late during the SDLC
    2. Not well suited for large, complex projects
    3. Lack of performance measuring techniques, due to lack of sprints and meetings
    4. Difficult to accommodate changing requirements during SDLC
    5. Big-bang Deployment; may lead to extensive deployment problems (High Risk)

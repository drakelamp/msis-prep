## During the MSIS program

During your time in the MSIS program you will be required to learn and use both agile and waterfall, two methodologies used across development lifecycles. These two methodologies will serve you across various assignments and projects throughout the program. However, you must understand the advantages and disadvantages of using each one. For now, we will focus primarily on waterfall, its concepts, and when it is best used. If you are interesting in learning more about agile, please refer to the appropriate module.

Curious about Agile and/or how Waterfall compares? Check out the following modules:
*  [Agile](/agile)
*  [Agile vs. Waterfall](/agile_waterfall)

## Major concepts

**You should have an understanding of the waterfall development methodology** and understand when it is best to apply it over other potential development methodologies.

1. Explain the _**seven phases of waterfall**_.
2. Understand the _**benefits**_ and _**disadvantages**_ of utilizing waterfall over agile.
3. Be able to _**determine if your project would be best served**_ using the methodology.

##Components Explained

**Disclaimer**: Oftentimes there is debate on if the waterfall methodology has five (5) or seven (7) phases. This is the  result of phases being combined; below we have ensured they are broken out but the subsequent resources may not do the same.

1. Phases of _**waterfall**_
    1. _**Planning:**_ Focuses on determining project goals and crafting a high-level plan for the intended project. This is the most fundamental and critical phase.
    2. _**Analysis:**_ This phase analyzes end user requirements and project goals and converts them into the defined system functions the organization intends to develop.
    3. _**Design:**_ Builds directly off of the first two phases and requires no coding to occur. This phase is  focused on establishing the technical needs of the project.
    4. _**Construction/Build:**_ Involves the main build-out of the desired solution, this phase tends to be code heavy and aims to meet the requirements set fourth throughout the previous phases.  
    5. _**Testing:**_ Occurs once main software development has concluded; issues may arise causing you to revert to the previous phase.
    6. _**Implementation/Deployment:**_ Product development has concluded and the final deliverable will now be put into use throughout an organization. This signals the move to post-development support.
    7. _**Maintenance/Support:**_ Occurs once the final product has been delivered and is actively being used within an organization. _When_, not if, issues arise, your team must be ready to respond and update  software to address those issues. Issues may require you to roll back the product version to a previous version.
2. Primary _**advantages**_ of waterfall
    1. Simple, easy to utilize on small projects
    2. Centralized, great for communication throughout the <abbr title = "Software Development Lifecycle"> SDLC </abbr>
    3. Easily managed
    4. Defined end goal throughout project duration

3. Primary _**disadvantages**_ of waterfall
    1. Working software/product is not produced until late during the SDLC
    2. Not well suited for large, complex projects
    3. Lack of performance measuring techniques, due to lack of sprints and recurring meetings
    4. Difficult to accommodate changing requirements during SDLC
    5. Big-bang Deployment; may lead to extensive deployment problems (High Risk)

## Resources

*  First, it may be beneficial for you to start with the following article, [SDLC - Waterfall Methodology Overview][tutorials-point][^citation-one]. This focuses on outlining the _**waterfall methodology**_ while going into detail regarding its _**phases**_ as well as its _**advantages and disadvantages.**_

*  Once you understand the fundamentals of waterfall, it is great to understand how it differs from other methodologies. The following article, [Waterfall vs. Agile: Must Know Differences][guru-article][^citation-two], touches on the _**key differences**_ between waterfall and agile.

## Practice

Below you will find a small number of questions; these are meant to simply test your knowledge of the material previously outlined. The best way to learn waterfall is to begin applying it within your day-to-day projects.

1. List out the seven main phases of the waterfall methodology:
<details class="example">
<summary>Answer</summary>
  Planning, Analysis, Design, Construction/Build, Testing, Implementation/Deployment, Maintenance/Support
</details>
2. Within the Waterfall methodology, are you able to revisit phases as time goes on?
<details class="example">
<summary>Answer</summary>
  Yes, the waterfall methodology does allow teams to move between phases as necessary
  throughout implementation and maintenance.
</details>
3. Which projects are generally best suited for Waterfall?
<details class="example">
<summary>Answer</summary>
  Non-chaotic, short term projects with a clear end goal
</details>
4. Are potential issues identified and addressed as you go when using the waterfall methodology?
<details class="example">
<summary>Answer</summary>
  No, if your goal is to identify issues as you build out a solution it is best you look at the
  Agile methodology. Waterfall does not aide itself well to continuous development.
</details>
5. Given the nature of Waterfall, is documentation produced throughout the development of a project?
<details class="example">
<summary>Answer</summary>
  Yes, one of the advantages of the Waterfall methodology is that documentation is
  generated throughout the process.

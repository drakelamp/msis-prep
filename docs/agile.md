## During the MSIS program

During your time in the MSIS program you will cover Agile, a now popular software development methodology found within the Information Technology industry. The content outlined throughout this module will ensure you have a basic understanding of the fundamental concepts related to Agile in order for you to make informed decisions regarding the use of the methodology.

Curious about Waterfall and/or how Agile compares? Check out the following modules:
*  [Waterfall](/waterfall)
*  [Agile vs. Waterfall](/agile_waterfall)

## Major Concepts

**You should be have an understanding of the Agile development methodology** and understand when it is best to apply it over other potential development methodologies.

- Define Agile, and know what it values
- Identify the primary advantages and disadvantages of Agile
- Describe the process of Scrum
- Explain the key terms of Scrum methodology that are listed in the exercises

## What is Agile?

In the software development world, Agile describes [a set of values and principles in a manifesto]( http://agilemanifesto.org/)for software development.

> "We are uncovering better ways of developing
> software by doing it and helping others do it.
> Through this work we have come to value:
>
> **Individuals and interactions** over **processes and tools**
> **Working software** over **comprehensive documentation**
> **Customer collaboration** over **contract negotiation**
> **Responding to change** over **following a plan**
>
> That is, while there is value in the items on
> the right, we value the items on the left more."
>
> -*Manifesto for Agile Software Development*

Aside from these fundamental values, Agile takes a collaborative approach to software development. The methodology values fast delivery, flexibility, feedback from end-users, and continuous development. These values are also shared with Scrum, a similar framework which will be touched upon later.

The following video (~12min) created by Mark Shead, an Agile coach and software engineer,[^1] explains Agile in-depth regarding its values and principals. Upon completion you should be familiar with the basic outline of Agile.

## Agile Model

Agile believes that software development projects are unique, and as a result they require continuous iterations tailored to suit the changing requirements at each stage. When working with Agile, teams turn projects into small, continuous deliverables spread out amongst many phases.

Releases happen at the conclusion of each phase. During a fixed time period, usually of two weeks, teams create a delivery according to the current outlined requirements. Phases are also commonly referred to as iterations. When an iteration concludes, developers gather feedback from the client and move forward to determine features for the next iteration.

## Agile: Best Practices

Read the following article from Harvard Business: https://hbr.org/2018/05/agile-at-scale

## Scrum

There are many frameworks within the Agile methodology. Below you will be introduced to Scrum, the most popular Agile framework.

### What is Scrum?

Scrum is an Agile methodology or framework that has become widely used by developers on software development projects. It applies and expands upon the fundamental values and principals of the Agile methodology while incorporating defined team roles, events, artifacts, and rules.

Read the following article, ["What Is Scrum Methodology?"](https://digital.ai/resources/agile-101/what-is-scrum), from digital.ai[^3] as it explains the Scrum methodology in detail. Pay close attention to the following key terms:

- Product Owner
- Scrum Master
- Sprint
- Daily Stand-up
- Retrospective
- Product Backlog

These terms are elaborated upon in the following video by Axosoft[^4]. Watch this video to better understand how these elements are  applied in software development. Pay close attention to the following key terms:

- User story
- Story point(s)

## Exercises

1. True/False
    - Agile values individuals and interactions while traditional SDLC values processes and tool
    - Agile values comprehensive documentation while traditional SDLC values working software
    - Agile values contract negotiation while traditional SDLC values customer collaboration
    - Agile values responding to change while traditional SDLC values following a plan
2. In your own words, define Agile. What is Agile, why should it be used for software development, and where does it shine?
3. In your own words, define Scrum. Explain the relationship between Scrum and Agile. Do you prefer one over another? Why?
4. Define the following key terms:
    - User story
    - Story point
    - Product Owner
    - Scrum Master
    - Sprint
      - Typically, how many days does a sprint last?
    - Daily Stand-up
    - Retrospective
    - Product Backlog
5. Assume that you are making a wristband that tracks health data. Try to think of some user stories of your software (at least 5+), and allocate story points to them use T-shirt size.

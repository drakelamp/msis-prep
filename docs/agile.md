## During the MSIS program

During your time in the MSIS program you will cover Agile, a now popular software development methodology found within the Information Technology industry. The content outlined throughout this module will ensure you have a basic understanding of the fundamental concepts related to Agile in order for you to make informed decisions regarding the use of the methodology.

Curious about Waterfall and/or how Agile compares? Check out the following modules:
*  [Waterfall](/waterfall)
*  [Agile vs. Waterfall](/agile_waterfall)

## Major Concepts

**You should have an understanding of the Agile development methodology** as well as understand when it is best to apply it over other potential development methodologies.

- _**Define**_ Agile, Scrum, and Kanban
- Understand the _**advantages**_ and _**disadvantages**_ of Agile
- Explain the _**key terms outlined within the Scrum section**_
- Be knowledgeable on _**how a Kanban board works**_
- Recognize the _**differences between Agile, Scrum, and Kanban**_

## Agile
### What is Agile?

Agile is an iterative approach to software development and project management which places value on fast delivery, flexibility, feedback from end-users, and continuous development. These values are also shared with Scrum, a similar framework which will be touched upon later.

## Scrum
### What is Scrum?

Scrum is an Agile methodology or framework that has become widely used by developers on software development projects. It applies and expands upon the fundamental values and principals of the Agile methodology while incorporating defined team roles, events, artifacts, and rules.

### Scrum Key terms

**Please note:** The following terms are most commonly heard when utilizing Scrum at our level; however, further application of the framework will require a much larger related vocabulary. We recommend you to check out the [Scrum Glossary](https://www.scrum.org/resources/scrum-glossary?gclid=CjwKCAjwx6WDBhBQEiwA_dP8rfsCgYpwGr7MPY7TcdJZGY8Q14AuB1jZEOSxNMs6QTohK0fnzcGhvhoCdyUQAvD_BwE)!


*  **Burndown Chart:**: A graphical representation of outstanding work versus time remaining. The X-axis represents time while the Y-axis represents work.
*  **Daily Stand-up:** A session which brings the team together each morning to give status updates, as well as highlighting any impediments the team may be facing.
*  **Product Backlog:** List of features, changes to existing features, bug fixes, or needed infrastructure changes that a team is asked to deliver in order to achieve a specific outcome.
*  **Product Owner:** An individual whom is held accountable for maximizing the value brought fourth from a project and the work of his/her team.  
*  **Retrospective:** A session focused on finding ways to identify potential pitfalls, past mistakes, while seeking out new ways to avoid mistakes in the future.
*  **Scrum Master:** Takes on a much more administrative role within a Scrum team; this individual is tasked with ensuring that the Scrum framework is followed as well as ensuring teams are working efficiently.
*  **Sprint:** Usually a short, time-boxed period of time in which the team works to complete an incremental portion of work. The goal of each Sprint is the production of a final deliverable.
*  **Story Points:** A way of measuring the effort needed to develop and complete an item stored within the Product Backlog.
*  **User Story:** An informal, yet descriptive outline of a desired feature within a system. Stories are written from the perspective of an end user.

### Agile vs. Scrum

Below you will find a short two-minute video outlining how the Scrum framework builds off of the Agile methodology throughout the development lifecycle.

## Kanban
### What is Kanban?

Kanban, much like Scrum, is an Agile framework which aims to alleviate the troubles that come with the software development lifecycle. It places an emphasis on visualizing the workflow of work-in-progress items. The overarching goal of the framework is to identify potential obstacles within your development process so they can be addressed quickly, without impacting your cycle time.

### Kanban Key Terms

Below you will find a list of the most commonly used terms when referencing the Kanban framework:

*  **Blocker:** An unforeseen factor (internal and/or external) which stands in the way of continuing to make progress on an item. In order for a factor to be considered a Blocker, work must cease.
*  **Bottleneck:** Bottlenecks, much like Blockers, can inhibit progress on items. However, bottlenecks oftentimes can be fixed by redistributing the work among a team in a manor that better fits the strengths of individuals.
*  **Kanban Board:** A visual tool used to represent work at various stages throughout the development cycle. The size of your Kanban board will depend on how many steps your organization has throughout the SDLC. <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bcid33tgq8A" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

*  **WIP (Work-in-Progress):** A term used to describe work that has either not been started or has yet be completed.
*  **WIP Limit:** Limits are often placed on WIP items in order to ensure that teams are not stretching themselves too thin. This allows members of the development team to focus on delivering a quality product in the quickest time possible.

### Scrum vs. Kanban

The following five-minute video touches on the differences between the Scrum and Kanban frameworks. Within this video you will learn more related to the Cadence, Roles, Scope, Uses, etc. across the two frameworks.

</details>
3.	Describe a Burn Down Chart.
<details class="example">
<summary>Answer</summary>
  A burn down chart represents the work left to do, versus the time remaining to do so. The charts X axis represents time and the Y axis represents outstanding work.
</details>
4.	What is a WIP Limit?
<details class="example">
<summary>Answer</summary>
  A WIP Limit, or Work in Progress Limit, attempts to limit work being completed across a team at any given point. Its main goal is to assist in identifying bottlenecks within a development process.
</details>
5.	What is a sprint?
<details class="example">
<summary>Answer</summary>
  A sprint is a short development cycle, usually lasting no more than two weeks which  involves the production of a deliverable.
</details>
6.	Describe Kanban.
<details class="example">
<summary>Answer</summary>
  Kanban, despite not being iterative, is an agile methodology which focuses on continuous development in place of sprint iterations.
</details>
7.	What are the advantages of the Agile methodology?
<details class="example">
<summary>Answer</summary>
  Reduced risk, faster development cycles, certainty surrounding scope and deliverables.
</details>
8.	Explain what a Kanban board is.
<details class="example">
<summary>Answer</summary>
  A Kanban board is a tool used to visually manage work flows. It does so by showing the work at various stages of a process within columns representing each stage of the development process.
</details>
9.	What are Story Points?
<details class="example">
<summary>Answer</summary>
  Story Points are an abstract system which is used to classify the difficulty of a story or feature. A common scale used is the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100).
</details>
10.	Are requirements gathered at the beginning of a project when using the Agile methodology?

  A small set of requirements are identified at the beginning of a project, however, as time and development goes on additional requirements are identified and worked into sprints.
</details>
11.	What is a user story?
<details class="example">
<summary>Answer</summary>
  A User story are written by the 'customer' in order to capture  system needs. They are helpful in determining the time needed to produce a deliverable.
</details>
12.	Does Agile prioritize documentation over working software?
<details class="example">
<summary>Answer</summary>
  No, Agile values working software over comprehensive documentation. As a result, each sprint will have a working deliverable.
</details>
13.	What are the responsibilities of a Product Owner?

##Use Case Diagrams

## During the MSIS program

During your time in the MSIS program you will be required to model processes using BPMN, primarily in the APA module. However, it is important that you understand general modeling techniques that may aid you throughout the program on various assignments and group projects. For this reason, we expect that you have experience with UML (Unified Modeling Language) and creating Use Case Diagrams.

You are encouraged to practice with Microsoft Visio as this is primarily used throughout the program. However, below are a few other options which will be sufficient.

## Major concepts

1. _**Actors**_: You will need to be able to identify actors within a case in order to understand who interacts with a system
2. _**Use Cases**_: You should be able to extract the main use cases of a case or story to represent tasks and how actors interact with those tasks.
3. _**Relationships**_ (Learn more in the _**Resources**_ section!)
    1. Association
    2. Generalization
    3. Include
    4. Extend

## Resources

There are plenty of great resources out there for learning how to effectively utilize Use Case Diagrams when representing the interaction between an actor/user and various use cases/tasks in a system. We have highlighted below a variety of these resources to assist you in understanding the basics of Use Case Diagrams as well as providing a simple refresher.

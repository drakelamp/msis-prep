## During the MSIS program

During your time in the MSIS program you will be required to model processes using _BPMN_, primarily in the _APA_ (Agile, Processes, and Automation) module. However, it is important that you understand general modeling techniques that may aid you throughout the program on various assignments and group projects. As a result, it is expected that students entering the MSIS Program are able to fully utilize _**UML**_ (Unified Modeling Language) when analyzing cases and creating Sequence Diagrams.

## Major concepts

_**Note:**_ The following information is expanded upon throughout the **Resources** section!

1. _**Actors**_: You should be able to identify actors, and how they might interact with the system. It is important to note actors can be either internal _or_ external.
2. _**Lifeline**_: You will need to be able to determine when it is appropriate to utilize a Lifeline for interactions.
3. _**Activations**_: You should be able to differentiate and accurately use _activations_ from _lifelines._
4. _**Messages**_: You ought to be able to determine when it is appropriate to utilize each of the five messages; failure to do so can lead to a breakdown within your Sequence Diagrams.
    1. Return Message
    2. Self Message
    3. Recursive Message
    4. Destroy Message
    5. Duration Message
5.  _**Notes**_: Notes, although not required, allow you to add valuable information to your Sequence Diagrams to assist those on the development team.

## Practice

Here is a small list of practice problems (with answers!) that you may find useful as you learn and/or refresh on Sequence Diagrams.

*  [ATM Withdrawal (Answer Provided)][atm-practice] As a user, arrive to the ATM and conduct the standard withdrawal process in order to retrieve money. This set of practice problems includes both a non-verifying and verifying sequence.

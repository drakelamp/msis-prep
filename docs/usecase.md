## During the MSIS program

During your time in the MSIS program you will be required to model processes using <abbr title = "Business Process Model and Notation"> BPMN </abbr>, primarily in the <abbr title = "Agile, Processes, and Automation"> APA </abbr> module. However, it is important that you understand general modeling techniques that may aid you throughout the program on various assignments and group projects. For this reason, we expect that you have experience with <abbr title = "Unified Modeling Language"> UML </abbr> and creating Use Case Diagrams.

You are encouraged to practice with Microsoft Visio as this is primarily used throughout the program. However, below are a few other options which will be sufficient.

## Major concepts

1. _**Actors**_: You will need to be able to identify actors within a case in order to understand who interacts with a system
2. _**Use Cases**_: You should be able to extract the main use cases of a case or story to represent tasks and how actors interact with those tasks.
3. _**Relationships**_ (Learn more in the _**Resources**_ section!)
    1. Association
    2. Generalization
    3. Include
    4. Extend

## Resources

There are plenty of great resources out there for learning how to effectively utilize _**Use Case Diagrams**_ when representing the interaction between an actor/user and various use cases/tasks in a system. We have highlighted below a variety of these resources to assist you in understanding the basics of Use Case Diagrams as well as providing a simple refresher.

*  [What is a Use Case Diagram?][visual-link][^citation-one] This article serves as a good overview of use case diagrams by offering insight into their components and how to identify Use Cases and the associated Actors.
